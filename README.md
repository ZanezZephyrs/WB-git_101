# WB-git_101

In this exercise every member need to complete 3 tasks, the tasks are explained below


## 1-Your first PR

You should create a branch from the develop branch, the branch name should follow the structure: feature/your_name/any_name, for example feature/thales/cool_branch.

In this newly created branch, you should create a new folder, the folder name should be your name.

Inside the folder you should create a python file (.py) named my_function.py, the file content can be anything but it must not be empty.

Once you finished your file, create a pull request to the develop branch


## 2- something went wrong

In this task you will need to fix a conflict, to start this task you must have finished the task 1 first.

Create another branch from the develop, the branch should be feature/your_name/fix_conflict.

Ask thales to setup this task for you, he will change the code of your my_function.py file in order to create a conflict, your task is to fix such conflict and create a pull request.


## 3 - the sweet sweet judgement

In this task you will participate in a code review, code reviews are essential to maintain code quality and team awareness of the project development.

Create a new branch, the name should be, feature/your_name/judge

in the folder created at task 1, create a new file called judge.py, in this file write code to solve any problem that you wish, it can be pretty basic, the file should have at least 20 lines( please avoid copying code from somewhere, the idea is that the code that you write should have some points to improve).

Some problems that you can solve:

- given 2 integers, print theirs sum, product, minimum multiple common and maximum common divisor.
- Implement binary search
- Implement some sorting algorithm
- Sum two matrices
- multiply two matrices
- given a list of strings, count how many are anagrams.

Once you finished your judge.py file, create a pull request from your branch to develop. This branch can only be merged when your other 3 colleagues approve the pull request. Also, you should go to the pull request of each of your colleagues and evaluate their code, feel free to ask for changes if you find fit.
